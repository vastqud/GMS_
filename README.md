This is code for an unfinished game that was intended to be released on the Roblox platform. 
Only a small portion of the codebase was ever finished, so this repository is just what I have so far. 
There are some cool things in here, like an over-the-shoulder camera system for combat, streaming-enabled compatible loading, etc
